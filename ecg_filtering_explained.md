# ðŸ«€ ECG Signal Processing with Advanced Filtering - Complete Guide

## ðŸ“Š Understanding ECG Signals

### What is an ECG Signal?
An ECG (Electrocardiogram) measures the electrical activity of your heart:
- **P Wave**: Atrial depolarization (atria contracting)
- **QRS Complex**: Ventricular depolarization (ventricles contracting) 
- **T Wave**: Ventricular repolarization (ventricles relaxing)
- **Frequency Range**: 0.5-40 Hz for diagnostic information

### Why Do We Need Filtering?

Raw ECG signals are contaminated with noise from:

1. **Baseline Wander (0.05-0.5 Hz)**
   - Caused by: Patient breathing, movement, electrode contact
   - Effect: Signal drifts up and down slowly
   - Solution: High-pass filtering

2. **Powerline Interference (50/60 Hz)**
   - Caused by: Electrical equipment, power lines
   - Effect: 50Hz or 60Hz sinusoidal noise overlay
   - Solution: Notch filtering

3. **Muscle Artifacts (20-200 Hz)**
   - Caused by: Patient muscle tension, movement
   - Effect: High-frequency noise spikes
   - Solution: Low-pass filtering

4. **Electrode Motion (0.1-10 Hz)**
   - Caused by: Loose electrodes, cable movement
   - Effect: Random amplitude variations
   - Solution: Adaptive filtering

## ðŸ”§ Filtering Pipeline Steps

### Step 1: Baseline Wander Removal
**Purpose**: Remove slow drift in the signal
```
Input: Raw ECG with baseline drift
â†“
High-pass filter (cutoff: 0.5 Hz)
â†“
Output: ECG with stable baseline
```

### Step 2: Powerline Interference Removal  
**Purpose**: Remove 50/60 Hz electrical noise
```
Input: ECG with electrical interference
â†“
Notch filter (50 Hz or 60 Hz)
â†“
Output: ECG without powerline noise
```

### Step 3: High-Frequency Noise Removal
**Purpose**: Remove muscle artifacts and high-frequency noise
```
Input: ECG with muscle artifacts
â†“
Low-pass filter (cutoff: 40 Hz)
â†“
Output: Clean ECG signal
```

### Step 4: Signal Quality Assessment
**Purpose**: Evaluate if the filtered signal is good enough
```
Input: Filtered ECG
â†“
Quality metrics calculation
â†“
Output: Quality score (0-100%)
```

## ðŸ“ˆ Mathematical Foundation

### High-Pass Filter (Baseline Removal)
**Transfer Function**: H(s) = s/(s + Ï‰c)
- Removes frequencies below cutoff
- Preserves ECG waveform shape
- Cutoff frequency: 0.5 Hz

### Low-Pass Filter (Noise Removal)
**Transfer Function**: H(s) = Ï‰c/(s + Ï‰c)  
- Removes frequencies above cutoff
- Smooths the signal
- Cutoff frequency: 40 Hz

### Notch Filter (Powerline Removal)
**Transfer Function**: H(s) = (sÂ² + Ï‰nÂ²)/(sÂ² + 2Î¶Ï‰ns + Ï‰nÂ²)
- Removes specific frequency (50/60 Hz)
- Minimal impact on nearby frequencies
- High Q factor for sharp notch
