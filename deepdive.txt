                    MY ECG-LLM MEDICAL RESEARCH PROJECT - WHAT I BUILT
===============================================================================

🏥 WHAT I ACCOMPLISHED
=====================
I successfully built a complete AI-powered ECG analysis system that can:
- Process heart monitor data like a professional medical device
- Use Google's Gemini AI to interpret ECG findings like a cardiologist  
- Generate medical reports in plain English
- Create professional medical visualizations
- Provide a foundation for serious cardiovascular research

🎯 THE PROBLEM I SOLVED
=======================
Before: Doctors spend hours analyzing ECG traces manually
After: My AI system analyzes heart data in seconds and explains findings clearly

I essentially created a "digital cardiologist" that never gets tired and can 
analyze thousands of ECGs instantly.
